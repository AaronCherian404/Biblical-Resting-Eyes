# Biblical-Resting-Eyes

A mindful screen break application that encourages regular breaks with Bible verse memorization.

## üìñ About

Bible Break is a Python-based desktop application that helps users maintain healthy screen time habits while strengthening their faith. The application runs in the background and periodically displays a full-screen break reminder with a Bible verse. To resume work, users must correctly type out the displayed verse, promoting both screen breaks and scripture memorization.

### üåü Key Features

- **Automatic Break Reminders**: Defaults to 20-minute intervals (customizable)
- **Full-Screen Break Mode**: Ensures users take a proper break
- **Bible Verse Memorization**: Contains 10 carefully selected verses
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Runs quietly in the background
- **Windows Support**: Built for Windows operating systems
